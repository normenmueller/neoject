# Overview

This ADL documents major design decisions for the `neoject` data import CLI tool. Neoject wraps Cypher-based graph initializations into structured execution pipelines and distinguishes **modular** (`-g`) from **monolithic** (`-f`) modes.

## Modes Summary

| Mode           | Command-line Flag | Input File(s)        | Transaction Wrapping | Intended Content       |
| -------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Modular**    | `-g`              | DML (+ optional DDL) | ‚úÖ (DML only)        | Pure DML (graph logic) |
| **Monolithic** | `-f`              | Mixed DDL + DML      | ‚ùå                   | Fully specified import |

## Allowed Statements by File Type

| File Type         | Cypher Statements Allowed                                     | Notes                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `--ddl-pre/post`  | `CREATE CONSTRAINT`, `DROP INDEX`, etc.                       | DDL only; read/write discouraged          |
| `-g` (graph)      | `CREATE`, `MERGE`, `MATCH`, `UNWIND`, `SET`, `WITH`, `DELETE` | DML only; no DDL or transactions allowed  |
| `-f` (monolithic) | Any valid Cypher (DDL + DML + transactions)                   | Treated as-is                             |

# ADR-001: Use shell script with `cypher-shell` for data import
<a name="adr-wrp-cshl"></a>

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To import `.cypher` files into Neo4j, multiple technical options were considered:

- `cypher-shell` (official Neo4j CLI)
- CSV + `LOAD CSV`
- APOC imports
- REST/HTTP APIs
- Custom clients (e.g., Haskell, Python, JavaScript)

Additionally, orchestration could have been done via:

- Bash shell script
- Haskell CLI
- Python script
- Makefile automation

## Decision

We use a Bash shell script (`neoject`) that invokes the officially supported `cypher-shell` command-line client.

## Rationale

- `cypher-shell` is officially maintained and cross-platform
- Bash is widely available, zero-dependency, and CI-friendly
- Easy integration into Makefiles, pipelines, or manual runs
- No external dependencies (e.g., Python, Haskell)

## Consequences

- Fast setup and simple distribution
- Passwords passed via CLI (‚Üí can be hardened later)
- Error handling delegated to `cypher-shell`
- Script complexity may grow over time

## Alternatives Considered

- ‚úÖ **Why Bash works now**:

  | Reason                    | Justification                                       |
  | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
  | OS proximity              | Can invoke binaries, manage files and logs easily   |
  | Lightweight               | No virtualenvs or builds required                   |
  | Minimal data modeling     | No complex in-memory objects needed                 |
  | DevOps-native             | Familiar to infra/CI engineers                      |

- üõë **Why Bash may fail later**:

  | Limitation               | Symptoms                               |
  | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
  | CLI parsing complexity   | Option validation becomes brittle      |
  | No structured logging    | Difficult to trace or log with levels  |
  | Hard to unit-test        | No dependency injection or mocks       |
  | Fragile error handling   | Exit code reliance without granularity |

- üîÑ **Migration paths**:

  | Language  | When to switch                                         |
  | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Python    | Rich CLI and data handling needed                      |
  | Rust      | Performance and static typing required                 |
  | Haskell   | Full type-safe orchestration and declarative pipelines |

## Future Considerations

- Migrate to Python or Haskell as complexity grows
- Extract reusable modules for schema or logging
- Support `.env` or password prompts for better security

# ADR-002: neoject owns transaction boundaries in modular mode
<a name="adr-own-trx"></a>

<!-- The All-or-Nothing ADR ;-) -->

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Graph DML files (`-g`) **must** contain only **declarative, transaction-free** Cypher statements:

- No Cypher shell meta-commands (e.g., `:begin`, `:commit`, `:rollback`)
- No DDL statements (e.g., `CREATE CONSTRAINT`, `DROP INDEX`)

These files are treated as graph data manipulations only. Transactional orchestration is the responsibility of the runtime (`neoject`).

## Decision

Neoject **automatically wraps** the contents of a modular graph DML file in a single transaction:

```cypher
:begin
<contents of -g file>
:commit
```

> üö® _Clarification_:
> `:begin`/`:commit` do **not** change Cypher variable scoping ‚Äî variables remain **per statement** unless explicitly passed via `WITH`. The wrapping **only** provides all-or-nothing execution (atomicity). User-supplied transaction markers in modular mode are **forbidden**; wrapping is always performed by `neoject`.

This happens only in `inject -g`. Monolithic mode (`inject -f`) executes the file exactly as given.

## Rationale

- Prevents partial writes if any statement fails
- Ensures atomic DML execution in modular imports
- Centralizes transaction control in one place (`neoject`)
- Avoids fragile and inconsistent manual transaction markup

## Technical Justification

Without wrapping, Neo4j (via `cypher-shell`) will execute each statement independently; a failure mid-file leaves earlier statements committed and later ones skipped.

Wrapping via `:begin ... :commit` ensures:

- All statements succeed or none do
- The Cypher shell returns a clear non-zero exit code on failure
- CI/CD runs are deterministic

The need for `WITH`/`MATCH` to carry variables across statements is a separate Cypher design rule ‚Äî wrapping does not bypass it.

## Consequences

- Modular DML files must not contain transaction boundaries
- Cypher variables must be propagated explicitly if reused
  (_This is by design of the Cypher language itself_)
- Monolithic files may include their own transactions and are executed as-is

## Alternatives Considered

- **Unwrapped graph file** = modular file executed statement-by-statement without `:begin/:commit` ‚Üí rejected as fragile and non-atomic
- Letting users wrap their own transactions ‚Üí rejected, too error-prone
- Wrapping each line separately ‚Üí breaks graph semantics and is inefficient

## Future Considerations

- `--raw` flag to bypass wrapping for expert scenarios
- Static validation to detect forbidden DDL or transaction markers in modular mode

# ADR-003: Execute modular graph initialization in two non-transactional and one transactional step
<a name="adr-atomic-dml"></a>

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A **modular graph initialization** is the triplet:

1. `--ddl-pre`: constraints, indexes, or other schema setup (runs non-transactionally)
2. `-g`: pure DML graph logic (runs **within a single explicit transaction**)
3. `--ddl-post`: optional schema updates or cleanup (runs non-transactionally)

Only the `-g` part is wrapped in `:begin ... :commit`. This separation allows schema changes to be applied before and after the DML, while keeping the data import atomic.

## Decision

Neoject executes a modular graph initialization as:

```plaintext
cypher-shell <"$DDL_PRE"
cypher-shell <<'EOF'
:begin
<contents of -g file>
:commit
EOF
cypher-shell <"$DDL_POST"
```

If any statement inside the `-g` transaction fails, **none** of its changes are committed, but the surrounding DDL parts remain applied.

(See [ADR-002](#adr-own-trx) for details on why wrapping is enforced in modular mode.)

## Rationale

- Schema changes (`--ddl-pre`/`--ddl-post`) can stand alone
- DML graph logic (`-g`) must succeed entirely or not at all
- Clean separation reduces coupling and improves maintainability

## Technical Justification

- Neo4j ACID guarantees apply only to statements within the same explicit transaction
- By isolating `-g` into one transaction, any failure causes a rollback of all graph data manipulations
- Schema changes remain in place, which is often desired (e.g., indexes for debugging a failed import)

## Consequences

- Modular imports run in exactly **three** distinct execution units:

  1) DDL pre (non-transactional)
  2) DML graph (atomic transaction)
  3) DDL post (non-transactional)

- Users can rely on `-g` being all-or-nothing, without worrying about partial graph writes

## Alternatives Considered

- Wrapping the entire triplet (`--ddl-pre`, `-g`, `--ddl-post`) in one transaction ‚Üí rejected because many DDL statements in Neo4j cannot be executed inside an explicit transaction, and separating schema operations from DML improves clarity and error recovery.
- Leaving `-g` unwrapped ‚Üí rejected as it allows partial data loads
- Forcing all imports to be monolithic ‚Üí rejected; modular mode is more flexible

## Future Considerations

- Optional batch execution for huge `-g` files (>10k statements)
- Allow configurable transaction size for modular graph initializations
- Retry logic for transient errors in the `-g` phase

# ADR-004: `clean-db` preserves schema metadata; `reset-db` purges everything
<a name="adr-cls-vs-rst"></a>

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Neoject offers two options to clear the database:

- `clean-db`: removes all nodes, relationships, indexes, constraints
- `reset-db`: drops and recreates the database completely

## Decision

| Operation     | Deletes Data | Deletes Schema | Deletes Metadata |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------------- |
| `clean-db`    | ‚úÖ           | ‚úÖ             | ‚ùå               |
| `reset-db`    | ‚úÖ           | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ               |

Neo4j **retains schema metadata** (labels, keys, rel types) unless the DB is dropped.

## Rationale

- Cleaning is sufficient for dev/test cycles
- Reset is required for truly fresh DB (e.g. CI/CD or introspection)
- Metadata like labels remain visible unless purged

## Technical Justification

Neo4j stores metadata in internal system stores. Only:

```cypher
DROP DATABASE <name>;
```

removes these entries.

## Consequences

- Tools like Neo4j Desktop may show labels/types after `clean-db`
- `reset-db` requires SYSTEM access
- Script must wait until recreated DB becomes ONLINE

## Alternatives Considered

- Using APOC to delete metadata (not possible)
- Resetting via file deletion (unportable)

## Future Considerations

- Add `--hard-clean` flag as alias to `reset-db`
- Provide metadata inspection command (`SHOW LABELS`, etc.)
- Warn user if SYSTEM access is missing

# ADR-005: Cypher modular style must avoid cross-statement variable references
<a name="adr-modular-style"></a>

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Cypher variables are **statement-local** unless passed via `WITH`.

This applies regardless of transaction wrapping. Many `.cypher` files fail silently by assuming that:

```cypher
CREATE (f:Function {id: 1});
CREATE (b:Body {id: 2});
CREATE (f)-[:HAS]->(b);  // üö´ f/b are not defined here
```

This creates _4 nodes_ and _no relationship_.

## Decision

Modular DML files **must** follow one of these valid patterns:

- **Pattern-matching**:

  ```cypher
  CREATE (f:Function {id: 1});
  CREATE (b:Body {id: 2});
  MATCH (f:Function {id:1}), (b:Body {id:2}) CREATE (f)-[:HAS]->(b);
  ```

- **WITH chaining**:

  ```cypher
  CREATE (f:Function {id: 1});
  CREATE (b:Body {id: 2});
  WITH f, b
  CREATE (f)-[:HAS]->(b);
  ```

- **Single statement**:

  ```cypher
  CREATE (f:Function {id: 1}), (b:Body {id: 2}), (f)-[:HAS]->(b);
  ```

## Rationale

- Prevents duplicate nodes and missing relationships
- Works in browser, CLI, CI/CD alike
- Avoids confusion from implicit Cypher behavior

## Technical Justification

Neo4j does **not** preserve variables across statements.

Wrapping in `:begin/:commit` ensures atomicity, but **not** variable visibility.

## Consequences

- All `.cypher` authors must use `WITH` or `MATCH`
- `neoject` does not validate this (yet)
- Failures may be silent unless tested manually

## Alternatives Considered

- Auto-rewriting Cypher (rejected: dangerous)
- Pre-validating for cross-scope variables (not implemented yet)

## Future Considerations

- Add `neoject lint` to statically check modular files
- Provide examples and tooling to verify graph shape post-import
