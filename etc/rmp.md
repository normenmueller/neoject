# Current

- Testing lager data sets
- Testing raw Cypher variants

Goal: ðŸ“Œ How should `pangrm` write CQL?

Or should there be a `-â€”injectable` for the CQL writer? Without this parameter, pure CREATE statements are generated, assuming variable binding. With this parameter, MATCH, MERGE, and UNWIND are used.

*Developer note*: This must be clarified before we continue with `pangrm`. We first need to know what `pangrm` or the CQL Writer should generate. But we can still continue working on the LDIF Reader!
